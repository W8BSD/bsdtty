Disable "hands off" optimized mode
Update Info
Read S-meter
	Reading is a positive integer in dB over S0.
Set/Get duplex... frequency and mode for both TX and RX.

The "hands off" mode will be the default mode and allows the program to
optimize access by agressively caching data.  For rigs with an interface lock,
the interface lock should be enabled unless it interferes with computer control
(such as in the TS-940S).  Even in this mode however, it should periodically
poll to update the state when possible.

This is the default because some rigs (ie: FT-736R) are write-only CAT.  It's
not actually possible to *read* anything.

When hands off is disabled, every piece of information must be read from the
rig between when the request is recieved and the response is sent.  This must
not be emulated.  A FT-736R must not support the "hands on" mode.

As a strict rule, no "get" function should perform any action that could
interfere with transmitting.  For example, if an interface only allows reading
the frequency/mode of the "current" VFO, attempting to get the freq/mode of
the other VFO must fail.  The code MUST NOT change the current VFO to read
the value.
